Embedding Images
================

You can embed a single image with `Connection.embed_image`, which
takes bytes, or `Connection.embed_image_file`, which takes a path to a
file.  There are also helpers `Connection.embed_images` and
`Connction.embed_image_files`, which will return a generator that
batches requests to the server::

    import basilica

    with basilica.Connection(API_KEY) as c:
        image_embedding = c.embed_image(BYTES)
        image_embedding = c.embed_image_file('/path/to/image/')
        for image_embedding in c.embed_images([BYTES1, BYTES2, ...]):
            ...
        for image_embedding in c.embed_image_files(['/path1', '/path2', ...]):
            ...

Embedding Sentences
===================

You can embed a single sentence with `Connection.embed_sentence`,
which takes a utf-8 string, or with `Connection.embed_sentences`,
which will return a generator that batches requests to the server::

    import basilica

    with basilica.Connection(API_KEY) as c:
        sentence_embedding = c.embed_sentence(BYTES)
        for sentence_embedding in c.embed_sentences([BYTES1, BYTES2, ...]):
            ...
